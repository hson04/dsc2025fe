<task>
Extract key skill groups and their specific requirements from a job description to create a structured JSON output compliant with the JobDetailsV2 and SkillGroupV2 models. Focus on identifying and categorizing required skills into distinct, non-overlapping groups for effective resume tailoring.
</task>

<job_description>
{job_description}
</job_description>

<instructions>
Follow these steps to extract and structure skill group information with clear categorization:

## 1. Skill Classification Strategy
**Technical Skills** - Group by technology domain:
- **Frontend Development**: Web UI frameworks (React, Vue, Angular), HTML/CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, responsive design
- **Backend Development**: Server-side languages (Node.js, Python, Java), APIs, databases, server architecture
- **Mobile Development**: Native (iOS/Android) or cross-platform (React Native, Flutter) development
- **Data & Analytics**: Data science tools, databases, analytics platforms, ML/AI frameworks
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), containerization, CI/CD, infrastructure
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing frameworks, automation tools, quality processes
- **Security**: Cybersecurity tools, compliance standards, security practices

**Non-Technical Skills** - Single group only:
- **Professional Skills**: Communication, teamwork, problem-solving, project management, languages, leadership, business acumen, adaptability, time management

## 2. Extraction Rules
- **Avoid Duplication**: Each requirement should appear in only one group
- **Be Specific**: Include exact technologies, years of experience, proficiency levels
- **Prioritize Precision**: "3+ years React experience" not just "Frontend experience"
- **Context Matters**: Consider the role's primary focus when categorizing borderline skills

## 3. Grouping Priorities (in order)
1. **Primary Technical Domain**: Main technology stack for the role
2. **Secondary Technical Skills**: Supporting technologies mentioned
3. **Professional Skills**: All soft skills, communication, and non-technical requirements in ONE group

## 4. Quality Checks
- No requirement appears in multiple groups
- Each technical group has clear technological focus
- Professional Skills group contains all non-technical requirements
- Group names use standard industry terminology
- Requirements are specific and actionable for resume tailoring

## 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't split similar technologies across multiple groups
- Don't create separate groups for soft skills (communication, teamwork, etc.)
- Don't duplicate experience requirements across groups
- Don't use vague group names like "General Skills" or "Other Requirements"

You are an expert resume writer with 10 years of experience in the IT industry, specializing in crafting ATS-optimized and job-specific resumes. Your task is to generate a personalized resume that aligns closely with the provided job description, using the user's data and optimizing for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and human readers.

**User Data (JSON):**
{user_data}

**Job Description (JSON):**
{job_data}

**Format Instructions:**
{format_instructions}

**Detailed Guidelines:**

1. **Personal Information**:
   - Include the fields: `name`, `email`, `phone`, `title`, `location`, `github`, `linkedin`. If a field is missing in `user_data`, set it to `null` (e.g., `"github": null`).
   - Use the exact information from `user_data.personal_info`.

2. **Work Experience**:
   - Extract relevant work experience from `user_data.work_experience`.
   - For each experience, include `company`, `position`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `location`, and `responsibilities`.
   - Optimize responsibilities to align with `job_data.description` and `job_data.required_skills`. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and incorporate keywords from `job_data`.
   - If an experience is less relevant, summarize it briefly. If no relevant experience exists, return the original `responsibilities` from `user_data`.

3. **Education**:
   - Extract education details from `user_data.education`, including `institution`, `major`, `type`, `gpa`, `courses`, `from_date`, `to_date`.
   - If no education data is provided, return an empty array `[]`.

4. **Projects**:
   - Extract projects from `user_data.projects`, including `name`, `description`, `role`, `technologies`, `from_date`, `to_date`.
   - Prioritize projects that match technologies or skills in `job_data.required_skills.languages` or `job_data.description`.
   - If no relevant projects exist, include all projects from `user_data` with concise descriptions.

5. **Certifications**:
   - Extract certifications from `user_data.certifications`, including `name`, `issuer`, `date`, `link` (set `link` to empty string if not provided).
   - If no certifications are provided, return an empty array `[]`.

   - For `technical_skills`, prioritize skills from `user_data.skill_section.technical_skills` that match `job_data.required_skills.languages` or `job_data.description`.
   - For `soft_skills`, include relevant skills from `user_data.skill_section.soft_skills` that align with `job_data.required_skills.content` (e.g., "Proficient in English").
   - If a skill in `job_data.required_skills` is missing in `user_data`, do not include it unless explicitly mentioned.

7. **Languages**:
   - List spoken languages from `user_data.languages`. If none are provided, return an empty array `[]`.

8. **Achievements**:
   - Extract achievements from `user_data.achievements`, including `title`, `description`, `date`, `issuer`.
   - If no achievements are provided, return an empty array `[]`.

9. **Keywords**:
   - Extract `keywords` from `job_data.keywords` and format as a comma-separated string (e.g., `"React Native, ReactJS, REST APIs"`). If no keywords are provided, return an empty string `""`.

10. **Important Rules**:
    - Write concise, professional content using strong action verbs (e.g., "Developed", "Optimized", "Led").
    - Prioritize quantifiable achievements from `user_data` (e.g., "Reduced latency by 30%").
    - Optimize for ATS by incorporating keywords from `job_data.keywords` and `job_data.required_skills`.
    - Return valid JSON matching the provided schema (`ResumeSchema`).
    - Do not infer information beyond what is provided in `user_data` and `job_data`.
    - Ensure all fields are included as specified in the schema, even if empty (e.g., `work_experience: []`).
